<h1>Posts</h1>
<p>This where a list of all your posts will appear, sorted by most recent. There will be short blurbs to describe each one, or a teaser of the intro text, whatever is easier.</p>
<% Post.all.each do |post| %>
  <%= link_to post.title, post_path(post.id) %>
<% end %>
<p>This is the link you will click to make a new post. This will only be available to people with encrypted admin access. Seriously though, it's kind of cool, I can encrypt stuff.</p>
